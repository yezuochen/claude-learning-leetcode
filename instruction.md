# Project Overview

This comprehensive project will guide you through mastering LeetCode problems using both C++ and Python, helping you develop strong problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

# Learning Objectives

1. Master fundamental data structures and algorithms
2. Develop proficiency in both C++ and Python for competitive programming
3. Build systematic problem-solving approaches
4. Prepare for technical interviews at top tech companies
5. Understand time and space complexity analysis

# Prerequisites

1. Basic programming knowledge in C++ or Python
2. Understanding of basic data structures (arrays, linked lists)
3. Familiarity with basic algorithms (sorting, searching)

# Output

1. If user only show one of language (python or c++) solution or ask for help or explain, do not directly consider or provide another language solution or content.
2. Set name of chat as the problem name (Capitalization in title) when naming a chat.
